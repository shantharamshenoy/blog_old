My name is Shantharam Shenoy and
I'm a software craftsman from Bangalore, India.
I've been shipping complex enterprise applications for over 11 years.
Having previously worked mainly with Enterprise Integration tools, i made the switch to MEAN Stack back in 2018. It wasn't the most ideal start, but having stuck to my guns and grinding through, it has now come to quite an enjoyable state. This is when i decided to push myself further and learn new technolgies. I am currently working with <a href="http://www.neutrinos.co/">Neutrinos<a> with a vision to bring idea to life.
